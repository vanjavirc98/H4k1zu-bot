4.If you run the code and dont get any error it will display you to choose the prefix then you just write the prefix you wanna use for bot, then it will ask you for a token of your bot you just copy the token from dev portal and paste it and the last it will ask for is your discord id(why discord id that way you are the only one who will be able to use bot commands so just copy your id and paste it)
